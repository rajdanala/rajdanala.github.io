Finally I decided to attend Data Science meetup that's been meeting in Regenstrief Institute for a while.

* Came to know about [H2O ML](http://h2o.ai/) and Azure ML from Stuart Ward's presentation about [Benchmarking ML Implementations:
Time/Accuracy Performance Utilizing R, Python, H2O, and Azure ML

* [Open Indy Brigade](http://www.indycivichack.com/) caught my attention. Laura Ellena from [Code for America Brigade](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/) shared the info about [Police Data initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/05/18/launching-police-data-initiative) how indy  choose to participate in the program. Fact is indy doesn't have any machine readable electronic data before 2014; Historic data is captured on paper. I was thinking about joining code of america fellowship (candidates selected for 2016...May be next year).

* You can find presentations at [DS Indy Meetup github pages website](http://dsindy.github.io/)
